# UCFBox

UCFBox is a cross-platform, fast-paced multiplayer party game that can be 
played on any iOS or Android device - as long as there is a stable internet connection.

UCFBox comes with three games for players to choose from: 
Citronot, KnightQuips, and Night Night Knightro.

Citronot is a free-response game that has players submitting a seemingly-true answer
in response to the question for the round, aiming to deceive the other players.  Players 
will then vote on what they believe to be the correct answer.  Successfully selecting
the fact for the round will give the player 20 points, and selecting another player's 
fake answer will give the player 10 points.

KnightQuips is another free-response game, where pairs of players are assigned two
questions to answer with a funny or clever response.  Players vote on their favorite response
after answering their given questions, and the player with the most voted-on responses wins!

Night Night Knightro is a round-based game, where players will communicate and work together
to figure out what player was secretly assigned the role "Knightro."  Players are all
given their own roles and have their own special abilities to help assist them.  Will you 
successfully guess who Knightro is, or will you see him outlive you?
